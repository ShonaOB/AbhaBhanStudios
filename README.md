<h1>ÁBHA BHÁN STUDIOS</h1>

<h2>Welcome to the Ábha Bhan Studios README document.</h2> 

<p>Ábha Bhan Studios is a business that offers courses as well as original artworks for sale. The aim of the website is to provide a platform on which to market and ultimately sell the courses on offer as well as the original artworks. </p>

<p>The website will target potential clients who may wish to find out more about the courses on offer, as well as those who wish to buy original artworks. Clients will be able to view the upcoming available courses, book a slot on those courses and also view and express interest in the available artworks.</p> 

<p>The scope of this project is to build the site functionality and allow it to launch with capacity to take bookings and orders via contact form. The e-commerce platform will be part of another project in the future when the scope will include this work. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>There are several features included in this initial scope project for Ábha Bhan Studios; these features are intended to bring a level of information to the client, and a seamless contact facility for the business. </p>

<h3>Features included in this project:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Landing Page including "about us" video and introduction paragraph</li>
    <li>Navigation Bar - including "Shop Courses", "Shop Artwork" and "Contact Us" navigation links, in order of priority.</li>
    <li>Shop Courses Page - to allow clients to view available courses and pricing, and to make contact about one of those courses should they wish to book. </li>
    <li>Shop Artworks Page - to allow clients to view available artworks and pricing, and to make contact should they wish to make a purchase.</li>
    <li>Contact Form - to gather data for the business from the potential clients</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Landing Page</h3>
<p>The landing page includes a header image showing a close up of the studio workshop. This page is intended to introduce Ábha Bhan Studios to the clients and provide a welcome message, some basic information about the business and an informative video. The video has not been set to "autoplay" for UX purposes, and to allow the client to control the interaction. </p>

<p>The landing page also includes a Welcome Message and an interactive video introducing the client to the business. </p>

<h3>Shop Courses</h3>
<p>The Shop Courses page is designed to show the client the available courses from Ábha Bhan Studios. The courses are structured in column format which is designed to be responsive to various screen sizes; for example, on a laptop it will show three columns across. On a mobile device it will show one column across.</p>
<p>This layout is designed to showcase the course header images which relate to each course available. Each course title is an active link which - for the scope of this project - will bring the client to the contact form to make an enquiry. *We believe that in the next project scope, this will be converted to an "add to cart" feature to allow the clients to book and pay online, therefore reducing the risk of "non-completion" of booking.</p>

<h3>Shop Artwork</h3>
<p>The Shop Artwork page is designed to exhibit the available original artworks from the Ábha Bhan Studios artists. The artwork is structured in column format, similar to the Courses page, which are designed to be responsive to screen size. There is also an explanatory paragraph at the top of the page, to explain that the online purchasing module is being built and in the meantime, artwork can be bought by making contact through the Contact page. *We believe that in the next project scope, this will be converted to an "add to cart" feature to allow the clients to order and pay online, therefore reducing the risk of "non-completion" of orders.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Contact Page</h3>
<p>The contact page features a contact form which can be used to make contact about a booking, a purchase, or a general query. Once completed, the client will be brought to a confirmation page, explaining that their message has been sent and someone will contact them soon. </p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>I am thankful for the following resources, which helped me to perfect my code to produce this site: </p>
<ul>

    <li>A positioning bug that was identified on the landing page was resolved with the assistance of <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/">this article on freecodecamp.com</a></li>
    <li>I would also like to thank a colleague from CodeInstitute who sent me to <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/"> this fun and valuable Flexbox game</a></li>
    <li>Slack has been very helpful throughout this process, and I recently found another README template with more information on UX, which I have encorporated below. This is a Code Institute Template.</li>

<h2>User Experience (UX)</h2>
<h3>User stories</h3>
<h4>The "First Time Visitor" Goals are:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>To understand what the company is about and find out more information about them. </li>
        <li>To view the products and services on offer.</li>
        <li>To navigate easily through the website.</li>
        <li>To find out where the company is based. </li>
        <li>To connect on Social Media for more up to date information.</li>
    </ul>
<h4>The "Returning Visitor" Goals are: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>To make contact with the business regarding an order or booking.</li>
        <li>To review the pricing on the course or artwork page</li>
        <li>To submit a contact request for a new booking or new purchase</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Any "Frequent User" Goals:</h4>
    <li>A frequent visitor is often looking for updated information and so the site will need to be maintained and updated.</li>
    <li>To find Social Media links</li>
<h2>Design</h2>
<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>
<p>As a creative business, the color scheme is muted to allow the artwork to take center focus. The footer and menu are in Light Sea Green to emphasise the natural location of the Studios, and the font is in Dark Slate Grey for ease of readability.</p>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>We have used the Montserrat font throughout the website as it is professional and appropriate for the business. For a creative edge on the headings and logo, we have used Montserrat Alternates, which is a slight variation on the regular font.</p>
<h3>Imagery</h3>
<p>As an artistic business, the imagery used was hugely important. Some photos have been taken from Unsplash.com or Pexels.com for a more professional feel, however the artwork photographs are from original works by the business owner.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Responsive on all device sizes</p>
<h3>Interactive elements</h3>
<p>The interactive elements include a video on the landing page. In future scoped projects we hope to include more, such as a 360 degree exhibit space and online purchasing.</p>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<p>Languages Used:
<ul>
    <li>HTML5</li>
    <li>CSS3</li>
</ul>
